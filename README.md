# Instagram Clone

### Introduction
This project is a full-stack Instagram web clone built using Vite, ReactJS, Chakra UI for the front end, and Firebase for the backend. Custom hooks are written using existing React hooks to help supplement the needed functionality. It replicates many of the core features of Instagram, allowing users to share images, like posts, follow/unfollow other users, edit their profiles, and more.

- **Liking Posts**: Users can like posts to show their appreciation.
- **Recommended Users List**: A list of recommended users is provided to users to help them discover new accounts to follow.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow and unfollow other users to see their posts in their feed.
- **Edit Profile**: Users can edit their profile information, including their profile picture, name, and bio.
